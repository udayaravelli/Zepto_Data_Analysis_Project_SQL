# 🛒 Zepto E-commerce SQL Data Analyst Portfolio Project

This is a complete, real-world data analyst portfolio project based on an e-commerce inventory dataset scraped from Zepto — one of India’s fastest-growing quick-commerce startups. This project simulates real analyst workflows, from raw data exploration to business-focused data analysis.

# 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to simulate how actual data analysts in the e-commerce or retail industries work behind the scenes to use SQL to:

✅ Set up a messy, real-world e-commerce inventory database

✅ Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore product categories, availability, and pricing inconsistencies

✅ Implement Data Cleaning to handle null values, remove invalid entries, and convert pricing from paise to rupees

✅ Write business-driven SQL queries to derive insights around pricing, inventory, stock availability, revenue and more

# 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and was originally scraped from Zepto’s official product listings. It mimics what you’d typically encounter in a real-world e-commerce inventory system.

Each row represents a unique SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) for a product. Duplicate product names exist because the same product may appear multiple times in different package sizes, weights, discounts, or categories to improve visibility – exactly how real catalog data looks.

🧾 Columns:

sku_id: Unique identifier for each product entry (Synthetic Primary Key)

name: Product name as it appears on the app

category: Product category like Fruits, Snacks, Beverages, etc.

mrp: Maximum Retail Price (originally in paise, converted to ₹)

discountPercent: Discount applied on MRP

discountedSellingPrice: Final price after discount (also converted to ₹)

availableQuantity: Units available in inventory

weightInGms: Product weight in grams

outOfStock: Boolean flag indicating stock availability

# 🔧 Project Workflow

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of what we do in this project:

1. Database & Table Creation
We start by creating a SQL table with appropriate data types:

```sql
CREATE TABLE zepto (
    sku_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    category VARCHAR(120),
    name VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
    mrp NUMERIC(8,2),
    discountPercent NUMERIC(5,2),
    availableQuantity INTEGER,
    discountedSellingPrice NUMERIC(8,2),
    weightInGms INTEGER,
    outOfStock BOOLEAN,
    quantity INTEGER
);
```

3. 🔍 Data Exploration
Counted the total number of records in the dataset

Viewed a sample of the dataset to understand structure and content

Checked for null values across all columns

Identified distinct product categories available in the dataset

Compared in-stock vs out-of-stock product counts

Detected products present multiple times, representing different SKUs

```sql
-- Count of rows
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM zepto;

-- Sample data
SELECT * FROM zepto
LIMIT 10;

-- Null Values
SELECT * FROM zepto
WHERE name IS NULL
   OR category IS NULL
   OR mrp IS NULL
   OR discountPercent IS NULL
   OR discountedSellingPrice IS NULL
   OR weightInGms IS NULL
   OR availableQuantity IS NULL
   OR outOfStock IS NULL
   OR quantity IS NULL;

-- Distinct Product Categories
SELECT DISTINCT category
FROM zepto
ORDER BY category;

-- Products In-stock vs Out of stock
SELECT outOfStock, COUNT(sku_id)
FROM zepto
GROUP BY outOfStock;

-- Products appearing multiple times (different SKUs)
SELECT name, COUNT(sku_id)
FROM zepto
GROUP BY name
HAVING COUNT(sku_id) > 1
ORDER BY COUNT(sku_id) DESC;
```

4. 🧹 Data Cleaning
Identified and removed rows where MRP or discounted selling price was zero

Converted mrp and discountedSellingPrice from paise to rupees for consistency and readability

```sql
-- Products with price = 0
SELECT * FROM zepto
WHERE mrp = 0 OR discountedSellingPrice = 0;

DELETE FROM zepto
WHERE mrp = 0;

-- Convert paise to rupees
UPDATE zepto
SET mrp = mrp / 100.0,
    discountedSellingPrice = discountedSellingPrice / 100.0;

SELECT mrp, discountedSellingPrice FROM zepto;
```

5. 📊 Business Insights
Found top 10 best-value products based on discount percentage

Identified high-MRP products that are currently out of stock

Estimated potential revenue for each product category

Filtered expensive products (MRP > ₹500) with minimal discount

Ranked top 5 categories offering highest average discounts

Calculated price per gram to identify value-for-money products

Grouped products based on weight into Low, Medium, and Bulk categories

Measured total inventory weight per product category

```sql
-- Q1. Find the top 10 best value products based on the discount percentage.
SELECT DISTINCT name, mrp, discountPercent
FROM zepto
ORDER BY discountPercent DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Q2. What are the products with high MRP but out of stock?
SELECT DISTINCT name, mrp
FROM zepto
WHERE outOfStock = 1 AND mrp > 300
ORDER BY mrp DESC;

-- Q3. Calculate estimated revenue for each category.
SELECT category,
       SUM(discountedSellingPrice * availableQuantity) AS total_revenue
FROM zepto
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_revenue;

-- Q4. Find all products where MRP > 500 and discount < 10%.
SELECT DISTINCT name, mrp, discountPercent
FROM zepto
WHERE mrp > 500 AND discountPercent < 10
ORDER BY mrp DESC, discountPercent DESC;

-- Q5. Identify the top 5 categories with highest average discount.
SELECT category,
       ROUND(AVG(discountPercent), 2) AS avg_discount
FROM zepto
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY avg_discount DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Q6. Find price per gram for products above 100g (best value first).
SELECT DISTINCT name, weightInGms, discountedSellingPrice,
       ROUND(discountedSellingPrice / weightInGms, 2) AS price_per_gram
FROM zepto
WHERE weightInGms >= 100
ORDER BY price_per_gram;

-- Q7. Group products into Low, Medium, Bulk categories.
SELECT DISTINCT name, weightInGms,
       CASE
           WHEN weightInGms < 1000 THEN 'Low'
           WHEN weightInGms < 5000 THEN 'Medium'
           ELSE 'Bulk'
       END AS weight_category
FROM zepto;

-- Q8. Total inventory weight per category.
SELECT category,
       SUM(weightInGms * availableQuantity) AS total_weight
FROM zepto
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_weight;
```
